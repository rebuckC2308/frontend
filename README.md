# Day 1
## Initialized Front-end of restaurant application
This application's (yet to be named) front-end was built by bootstrapping it with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Why React?
We chose to use React because it is flexible and can build a quality UI. It is also easy to test with the node command line.
Overall we just wanted to create an application with a high quality UI that could be used on the web or one's mobile application.


### Setting up
Set up was fairly simple as we installed via npm
A template was not selected and after initilization we realized we had the option to initiate React to create a TypeScript application

We've decided we could try to implement TypeScript later but first wanted to complete this set up and move on to initializing the back-end of the application.
